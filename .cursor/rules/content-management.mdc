# Content Management Guide

## Content Collections
Content is managed through Astro's content collections in `src/content/`. The schema is defined in [content.config.ts](mdc:src/content.config.ts).

## Blog Posts
Blog posts should be placed in `src/content/blog/` and follow the schema defined in the content config.

## Notes
Notes are small "thoughts" that aren't big enough to be full blog posts. They should be placed in `src/content/notes/` and follow the schema defined in the content config.


## Using Content
To query content in your pages:

```astro
---
import { getCollection } from 'astro:content';

const posts = await getCollection('blog');
---
```

## Content Structure
Each content entry should include:
- Frontmatter metadata (title, date, tags, etc.)
- Markdown content
- Optional images in the `src/assets/` directory

## Best Practices
1. Use consistent frontmatter fields as defined in [content.config.ts](mdc:src/content.config.ts)
2. Keep content organized by type
3. Use relative paths for assets
4. Follow the defined content schema
