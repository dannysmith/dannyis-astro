# Definition of Ready (DoR) & Definition of Done (DoD) â€” Personal Blog

## Purpose

To ensure all tasks meet clear, consistent standards before work begins (Definition of Ready) and before they are considered complete (Definition of Done). This rule guides Cursor and contributors in maintaining quality, clarity, and accountability throughout the development process.

## Status Definitions

- **Ready:** A task is considered "Ready" when it meets all DoR checklist items below and can be picked up for active development.
- **Done:** A task is considered "Done" when it meets all DoD checklist items below and is shippable, meeting all acceptance criteria.

## Philosophy

Keep things lightweight and flexible, but ensure clarity, completeness, and quality for every change.

## Content-Only Changes

This does not apply to **purely** content changes, including new (or edited) Notes and Articles (ie md or mdx files in `src/content`) and their associated assets (images etc) and content-only updates to static pages like `/now.astro`.

## Definition of Ready (DoR)

A small task is "Ready" when:

- [ ] The scope and purpose are clear enough that a junior developer would be able to complete the task in a short, focussed session. Implementation details, open questions and possible blockers have been considered.This has all been documented in either [TASKS.md](mdc:tasks/TASKS.md), a new file in `docs/prds` or a GitHub issue.

Larger features and changes are "Ready" when:

- [ ] A Product Requirements Document (PRD) exists in `/docs/prds/` clearly explaining the problem, requirements, and approach and has been through as much of the process outlined in [planning-process-overview.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/planning-process/planning-process-overview.mdc) as is appropriate for the size of the change.
- [ ] The change has been broken down into smaller tasks which are detailed in the PRD, each of which has enough context and information that a junior developer would be able to complete in a single focussed session.


## Definition of Done (DoD)

A task is "Done" when:

- [ ] If a PRD is being used, it meets the requirements described.
- [ ] Any relevant documentation (including `/docs/`, styleguides, or code comments) is updated.
- [ ] If components or important styles are changed or added, they have been added or updated in the styleguide page.
- [ ] All relevant Cursor rules in `.cursor/rules/` have been updated to reflect any new patterns, rules, or examples introduced by the change.
- [ ] The change follows all relevant rules and best practices in `.cursor/rules/` (e.g., component guidelines, styling, performance, accessibility etc).
- [ ] There are no linting, formatting or type errors (obviously) and all automated tests are passing.
- [ ] The code is committed, pushed to a branch and a pull request (PR) is open against `main`.
- [ ] All GitHub PR checks are passing, including a successful Vercel preview build.
- [ ] The Vercel preview deploy has been manually reviewed and looks correct.
- [ ] The PR has been merged to `main` and the production site has been checked and confirmed working.

### Notes

- For experiments or drafts, just note that status in the task.
- There should be no type errors, Prettier formatting errors, or similar issues (these should be caught by automated checks).
- The goal is clarity and completeness, not process for its own sake.
