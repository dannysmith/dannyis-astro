# Design and Brand Guidelines

## Site Purpose and Philosophy

### Why This Site Exists

This personal website serves as Danny's corner of the web with two main purposes:
1. **Content Platform**: A place to share thoughts, experiences, and work through blog posts and notes
2. **Creative Playground**: A space to experiment with code, especially CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and AI-assisted coding tools

### Core Values

- **Simplicity**: Minimal dependencies, clean code, straightforward user experience
- **Content-First**: Design decisions prioritize content readability and accessibility
- **Authenticity**: The site reflects personal style and values
- **Performance**: Fast loading times and optimal user experience across devices
- **Maintainability**: Easy to update and extend without unnecessary complexity
- **Fun**: Managing and evolving the site should be enjoyable, not a chore

### User Needs

- **Danny**: Express freely, have fun with writing/design/code, connect with people
- **Interested Reader**: Read content in peace, optionally get notified of new content
- **Person Checking Danny Out**: Determine if Danny can help them, find contact information

## Visual Design Philosophy

### Core Aesthetic

The site evokes a **clean, typographically-driven, experimental feel** — blending personal expression with classic graphic design influences. It's intentionally **not generic or safe**; it should feel like a **personal zine-meets-manifesto** with strong visual identity.

### Design Inspirations

- **Current site** (`danny.is`) and its stark, oversized typography
- **Constructivist and modernist layouts** (El Lissitzky, Jan Tschichold, Paul Schuitema)
- **Mid-century grid design systems** with asymmetric balance and bold diagonals
- **Monochrome/minimal colour palettes** with accent tones (red, coral, cream)
- **Notion-style simplicity** combined with expressive typographic play

### Design Tone

- Feels **personal**, **experimental**, and **intentional**
- A space for ideas and design play — not just a portfolio
- Leans into **design as authorship** rather than "professional blandness"
- **Sharp, beautiful, text-first, and minimal**

## Typography System

### Hierarchy and Usage

Typography is **central** — large, expressive, and layout-defining.

#### Article Typography (Long-form Content)
- **Primary Font**: Literata (variable font) - serif for bookish, elegant feel
- **Base Size**: 16px with fluid scaling using clamp()
- **Line Height**: 1.5 (24px baseline grid)
- **Advanced Features**:
  - **Drop caps** for article openings
  - **Ligatures** and **small caps**
  - **Old-style figures** and **fractions**
  - **Optical margin alignment**
  - **Hanging punctuation**

#### UI Typography (Navigation, Interface)
- **Focus**: Readability and versatility
- **Usage**: Navigation, metadata, UI elements

#### Expressive Typography
- **Oversized headlines** that define layout
- **Variable fonts** with advanced OpenType features
- **Rotated text** and **overlapping elements** where appropriate
- **Typographic banners** and announcements

## Color System

### Primary Palette

Based on the established personal brand palette, the site uses a **reduced, focused selection**:

#### Core Colors
- **Base Background**: Warm off-white / paper tone (`--c-beige-bg`)
- **Primary Text**: Black or near-black (`--color-grey-800`)
- **Primary Accent**: Red/coral (`--c-primary` = `--color-red-500`)

#### Extended Palette
See [global.css](mdc:src/styles/global.css)

#### Link Colors
- **Default Links**: Primary accent color
- **Visited Links**: Purple variants
- **Mobile Links**: Stronger red for touch interfaces

### Color Usage Principles
- **Monochrome base** with **strategic accent color**
- **Easy global changes** via CSS variables
- **Dark mode consideration** for future implementation
- **Consistent brand expression** across all elements

## Layout Principles

### Grid System
- **Heavily grid-based** but with **permission to break conventions**
- **20px base grid** with flexible application
- **Asymmetry is encouraged** over rigid symmetry
- **Sharp, intentional whitespace** and strong alignment cues

### Layout Patterns
- **Diagonal lines** and **rotated elements** where appropriate
- **Overlapping text/image elements** for visual interest
- **Content sections may break conventional grid layouts**
- **Full-bleed images** and content when needed

### Responsive Approach
- **Mobile-first** design methodology
- **Fluid typography** using clamp() functions
- **Container queries** for component-level responsiveness
- **Optimized for all screen sizes**

## Component Design Philosophy

### Visual System
- **Component-driven** with consistent design language
- **Navigation lists** resembling homepage style
- **Clean, card-style embeds** for external content
- **Typographic banners** and announcements

### Content Presentation
- **Articles**: Bookish, elegant, focused reading experience
- **Notes**: Card-like, snippet feel in feed format
- **Visual hierarchy** distinguishes content types clearly

### Interactive Elements
- **Lightbox functionality** for images
- **Smooth, intentional animations**
- **Touch-friendly** interface elements
- **Keyboard navigation** support

## Brand Expression

### Voice and Personality
- **Personal and authentic** rather than corporate
- **Experimental and playful** while maintaining professionalism
- **Confident in design choices** without being pretentious
- **Welcoming to readers** while expressing individual style

### Content Approach
- **Ideas and design play** over portfolio presentation
- **Quality over quantity** in content creation
- **Timeless design** that ages well
- **Personal expression** through visual and written content

This design system should guide all visual decisions while maintaining flexibility for creative expression and evolution over time.
