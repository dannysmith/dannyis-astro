# Task: Better Styling

Once we have experimenting with and decided on any typeface changes, we should work over the styleguide and deal with each element to ensure it's well styled. The check list below includes those which are not as good as they should be right now.

## Default Typography Layer

- [ ] HR
- [ ] Tables
- [ ] Inline Code
- [ ] Blockquotes
- [ ] Lists
- [ ] Lists with .long-list-items
- [ ] Checklists

- [ ] Basic Flow

## Content Components

- [ ] BasicImage
  - [ ] Framed
  - [ ] Framed with Caption
- [ ] BookmarkCard
- [ ] ButtonLink
  - [ ] Block
  - [ ] Inline
- [ ] Callout
- [ ] Accordian
- [ ] Grid

## UI Components

- [ ] Pill
- [ ] ContentCard
  - Articles
  - Notes

## HTML Elements

We need to decide where to put these styles, some of them may be best-placed in the reset, or base layers, some may be better in default typography. Any advanced styles for things like forms should almost certainly belong in ui-style.

- [ ] Fieldset & Legend
- [ ] Inputs & Labels
- [ ] Selects
- [ ] Textareas
