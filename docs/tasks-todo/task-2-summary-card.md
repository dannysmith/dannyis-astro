# Task: Summary Cards for Articles and Notes

Okay, pretty soon I'm going to want to be able to include articles and notes as a kind of card. You can imagine on the homepage I want to include the latest two articles and the latest three notes as cards. These cards should obviously include the title, they should include some marker as to whether it's a note or an article and should be expandable in the future if I have other content types. They should maybe include some kind of summary, which might mean we have to generate those summaries by grabbing the first meaningful text from the content. and ideally I would simply be able to pass in a note or article Astro object which produces one of these cards. Clearly these also need to be responsive so that they can be placed anywhere in any width container and still behave correctly. Obviously clicking on them should take you to the actual article. If there is a cover image, it should also include that in the card.
