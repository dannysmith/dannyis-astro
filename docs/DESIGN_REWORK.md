# Sprint - Finishing v1 of my Personal Website

This astro site is currently live on https://danny.is, but I've never really felit like it was "finished". So the objective of this sprint is to get this site to a place where I'm happy enough with it that I can call it "finished" for the time being.

By the end of this sprint we should have a performant, accessible and maintainable static site with:

1. A beautiful homepage, about page (and index pages for Articles and Notes).
2. Beautifully typeset long-form articles.
3. Beautiful Note pages.
4. The components I need to author Notes and Articles in MDX without any frustration (callouts, embeds, images, mini-layout grods bookmarks, notion links, lists, footnotes, blockquotes etc etc).
5. Good SEO and OG data for when people share links to my stuff.
6. Clean code which is easy for me and AI tools to understand and change in the future.
7. Enough quality documentation (and Cursor rules etc) that I'm excited to add new things and make changes because I can do so quickly and with quality.

## Tasks - Next Up

The `/docs/design-reset-tasks` directory contains files describing the tasks I think are nececarry to achieve this.
