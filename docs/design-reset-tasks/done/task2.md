## Task: Make NoteCard and Note pages Beautiful

The NoteCard component which is used to render my notes currently looks horrible. I want it to look beautiful. This means:

- Make default typography more beautiful when it's used for non BlogPost body copy (as it is in a Note). This includes inline elements like links, lists etc.
- Improve the design of the actual NoteCard and its contents.

See https://sachagreif.com/ for a nice example of a card displayed on a page.
