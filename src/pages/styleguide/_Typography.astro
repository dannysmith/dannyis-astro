  <!-- 1. Paragraphs & Basic Inline Text -->
  <h3 id="paragraphs-inline">Paragraphs & Basic Inline Text</h3>
  <SGTypographySwitcher>
    <h2>The Craft of Writing for the Web</h2>
    <p>
      Good writing finds its way to readers through <em>clarity</em> and <strong>purpose</strong>.
      Whether you're crafting a technical specification or a personal reflection, the fundamentals
      remain the same. A well-structured paragraph flows naturally, guiding the reader from one idea
      to the next without friction. This is especially true when writing about complex topics like <a
        href="/writing/">software development</a
      > or <a href="https://example.com">design systems</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The difference between <b>bold</b> and <strong>strong</strong> is subtle but meaningful. Bold (<code
        >&lt;b&gt;</code
      >) is purely stylistic, while strong (<code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>) conveys semantic
      importance. Similarly, <i>italic</i> differs from <em>emphasis</em>&mdash;one is a visual
      treatment, the other tells screen readers to stress the word. In 1984, these distinctions
      didn't matter much. By 2024, they're essential for accessibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider the office filing cabinet: it organises information efficiently, but finding specific
      files still requires effort. Digital systems offer the same trade-offs. A good filing system
      might store 1/2 of your documents in frequently-accessed folders while archiving the remaining
      3/4 for occasional reference. The efficacy of any system depends on how well it fits your
      workflow.
    </p>

    <h2>Links: Regular vs SmartLink</h2>
    <p>
      In MDX content, markdown links automatically become <code>&lt;SmartLink&gt;</code> components.
      This paragraph uses regular <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags: here's an
      <a href="/notes/">internal link</a> and an
      <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">external link</a>.
      Notice you must manually add <code>target="_blank"</code> and <code>rel</code> for external links.
    </p>
    <p>
      This paragraph uses the <code>&lt;SmartLink&gt;</code> component instead. Here's an
      <SmartLink href="/notes/">internal link</SmartLink> and an
      <SmartLink href="https://github.com">external link</SmartLink>. SmartLink automatically
      detects external URLs, adds the arrow indicator, and handles <code>target</code>/<code
        >rel</code
      >
      attributes. It makes authoring content significantly easier.
    </p>

  <!-- 2. Technical & Specialized Inline Elements -->
  <h3 id="technical-inline">Technical & Specialized Inline Elements</h3>
  <SGTypographySwitcher>
    <h2>Keyboard & Interface Patterns</h2>
    <p>
      Modern applications rely on keyboard shortcuts for efficient navigation. Press
      <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> to save, or <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>
      to open the command palette. On macOS, the <kbd>Option</kbd> key often reveals hidden functionality.
      These conventions emerged from the office software era and persist today.
    </p>
    <p>
      When documenting changes, use <del>deleted text</del> to show what was removed and
      <mark>highlighted text</mark> to draw attention to important updates. The <s>strikethrough</s>
      element (<code>&lt;s&gt;</code>) indicates content that's no longer accurate but remains for
      historical context, while <del>deletion</del> (<code>&lt;del&gt;</code>) marks actual removed
      content.
    </p>
    <h2>Scientific & Technical Notation</h2>
    <p>
      In scientific writing, superscripts and subscripts are essential. Water is written as H<sub
        >2</sub
      >O, while Einstein's famous equation is E = mc<sup>2</sup>. The <var>x</var>
      variable in f(<var>x</var>) = <var>x</var><sup>2</sup> + 2<var>x</var> + 1 represents any real
      number. When the command <samp>Build complete</samp> appears in your terminal, you know the process
      finished successfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      <small
        >Small print often contains legal disclaimers or supplementary information that doesn't
        warrant full-size text.</small
      > The book <cite>The Elements of Typographic Style</cite>
      by Robert Bringhurst remains the definitive reference for typography. As he notes,
      <q>Typography exists to honor content.</q>
    </p>
    <h2>Definitions & Abbreviations</h2>
    <p>
      A <dfn>design token</dfn> is a named entity that stores a visual design attribute. The <abbr
        title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr
      > defines web standards, while
      <abbr>CSS</abbr> (no title attribute) handles styling. Notice how abbreviations with titles show
      a dotted underline indicating more information is available on hover.
    </p>
    <p>
      For emphasis beyond italics, use the <Highlight>highlight component</Highlight> to make text pop
      with a background colour. For formal titles and acronyms in running text,
      <SmallCaps>Small Caps</SmallCaps> provides a distinguished appearance that doesn't disrupt the
      flow of reading.
    </p>

  <!-- 3. Headings (H1-H6) -->
  <h3 id="headings">Headings</h3>
  <SGTypographySwitcher>
    <h1>Finding Flow in Creative Work H1</h1>
    <p>
      The first-level heading establishes the primary topic. It should be used
      sparingly&mdash;typically once per page. In this example, we explore the art of finding flow
      in creative work, a topic that affects writers, designers, and developers alike.
    </p>

    <h2>The Office Environment H2</h2>
    <p>
      Second-level headings divide major sections. They're the workhorses of content structure,
      appearing frequently throughout longer documents. A good heading hierarchy helps readers
      navigate efficiently and understand the relationships between ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      The modern office has evolved significantly since the filing cabinet era. Open floor plans,
      remote work, and digital-first workflows have transformed how we collaborate. Yet the
      fundamental need for focused work time remains unchanged.
    </p>

    <h3>Efficient Filing Systems H3</h3>
    <p>
      Third-level headings break down subsections. They're useful for grouping related content
      within a major section. Here we might discuss specific strategies for organizing digital files
      or managing reference materials.
    </p>

    <h4>Configuring Default Folders H4</h4>
    <p>
      Fourth-level headings are less common but valuable for detailed technical content. In
      documentation, they might describe specific configuration options or step-by-step instructions
      within a larger procedure.
    </p>

    <h5>Affiliate Programme Details H5</h5>
    <p>
      Fifth-level headings rarely appear outside deeply nested documentation. When you find yourself
      reaching for <code>&lt;h5&gt;</code>, consider whether your content structure might benefit
      from reorganisation.
    </p>

    <h6>Sufficiently Deep Nesting H6</h6>
    <p>
      Sixth-level headings exist for completeness but suggest your document structure may be overly
      complex. Most content works well with three or four heading levels at most.
    </p>
  </SGTypographySwitcher>

  <!-- 4. Blockquotes -->
  <h3 id="blockquotes">Blockquotes</h3>
  <SGTypographySwitcher>
    <h2>Words Worth Quoting</h2>
    <p>
      Sometimes the best way to make a point is to let someone else make it for you. Blockquotes set
      quoted material apart from your own words, giving proper weight to borrowed wisdom.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The details are not the details. They make the design. This principle guides everything from
        typography to interface design&mdash;the small decisions accumulate into the overall
        experience.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The plain HTML <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> above is what markdown produces. For attributed
      quotes with citations, use the <code>&lt;BlockQuoteCitation&gt;</code> component.
    </p>
    <BlockQuoteCitation author="Charles Eames">
      <p>
        Design is a plan for arranging elements in such a way as best to accomplish a particular
        purpose.
      </p>
    </BlockQuoteCitation>
    <p>You can add a source title and URL for proper attribution:</p>
    <BlockQuoteCitation
      author="Steve Jobs"
      title="Stanford Commencement Address"
      url="https://news.stanford.edu/2005/06/12/youve-got-find-love-jobs-says/"
    >
      <p>
        Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied
        is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what
        you do.
      </p>
    </BlockQuoteCitation>
    <p>
      For less prominent quotes, use the <code>small</code> prop:
    </p>
    <BlockQuoteCitation author="Anonymous" small>
      <p>The best time to plant a tree was twenty years ago. The second best time is now.</p>
    </BlockQuoteCitation>
  </SGTypographySwitcher>

  <!-- 5. Lists: Unordered -->
  <h3 id="lists-unordered">Unordered Lists</h3>
  <SGTypographySwitcher>
    <h2>Getting Things Done</h2>
    <p>
      Unordered lists work well for items without inherent sequence. Here's a workflow checklist for
      publishing content:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Write the first draft without editing</li>
      <li>Let it rest for at least a day before revising</li>
      <li>Read aloud to catch awkward phrasing</li>
      <li>
        Check all links and references
        <ul>
          <li>Verify internal links point to existing pages</li>
          <li>Confirm external links are still valid</li>
          <li>Update any outdated citations</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Run spell check and grammar tools</li>
      <li>Preview in both light and dark modes</li>
      <li>Publish and share on social media</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Lists with inline formatting help clarify complex items:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Semantic HTML</strong> &ndash; use elements for their meaning, not appearance</li>
      <li><em>Progressive enhancement</em> &ndash; start with content, layer on interactivity</li>
      <li>
        Efficient <code>CSS</code> &ndash; leverage the cascade, avoid unnecessary specificity
      </li>
    </ul>
  </SGTypographySwitcher>

  <!-- 6. Lists: Ordered -->
  <h3 id="lists-ordered">Ordered Lists</h3>
  <SGTypographySwitcher>
    <h2>A Recipe for Success</h2>
    <p>
      Ordered lists suit sequential steps or ranked items. Here's how to approach a complex
      refactoring project:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Understand the existing code thoroughly before changing anything</li>
      <li>Write tests that verify current behaviour</li>
      <li>
        Make small, incremental changes
        <ol>
          <li>Extract methods for repeated logic</li>
          <li>Rename unclear variables and functions</li>
          <li>Simplify complex conditionals</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Run tests after each change to catch regressions early</li>
      <li>Document significant architectural decisions</li>
      <li>Review with colleagues before merging</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Ordered lists also work for rankings, like the most common typography mistakes:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Using straight quotes instead of curly quotes</li>
      <li>Confusing hyphens, en-dashes, and em-dashes</li>
      <li>Forgetting to kern display type</li>
    </ol>
  </SGTypographySwitcher>

  <!-- 7. Lists: Checklists -->
  <h3 id="lists-checklists">Checklists</h3>
  <SGTypographySwitcher>
    <h2>Task Lists from MDX</h2>
    <p>
      Checklists use GitHub-flavoured markdown syntax. This is rendered from an actual MDX file to
      ensure styling matches real content:
    </p>
    <ChecklistContent />
  </SGTypographySwitcher>

  <!-- 8. Lists: Density-Based Spacing -->
  <h3 id="lists-density">List Density</h3>
  <SGTypographySwitcher>
    <h2>Automatic Spacing for Long List Items</h2>
    <p>
      Lists with short items use tight spacing, while lists with paragraph-like items automatically
      receive more generous spacing. The <code>.long-list-items</code> class is added by a rehype plugin
      when the average text length per item exceeds a threshold. This is rendered from MDX to test the
      plugin:
    </p>
    <ListDensityContent />

  <!-- 9. Tables -->
  <h3 id="tables">Tables</h3>
  <SGTypographySwitcher>
    <h2>Tabular Data</h2>
    <p>
      Tables organize data into rows and columns. In running text, numerals typically use old-style
      figures (like 1984 or 2024), but tables benefit from lining numerals that align vertically for
      easy scanning.
    </p>
