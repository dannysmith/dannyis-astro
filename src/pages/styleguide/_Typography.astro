    <h2>The Craft of Writing for the Web</h2>
    <p>
      Good writing finds its way to readers through <em>clarity</em> and <strong>purpose</strong>.
      Whether you're crafting a technical specification or a personal reflection, the fundamentals
      remain the same. A well-structured paragraph flows naturally, guiding the reader from one
      idea to the next without friction. This is especially true when writing about complex topics
      like <a href="/writing/">software development</a> or <a href="https://example.com">design systems</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The difference between <b>bold</b> and <strong>strong</strong> is subtle but meaningful.
      Bold (<code>&lt;b&gt;</code>) is purely stylistic, while strong (<code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>)
      conveys semantic importance. Similarly, <i>italic</i> differs from <em>emphasis</em>&mdash;one
      is a visual treatment, the other tells screen readers to stress the word. In 1984, these
      distinctions didn't matter much. By 2024, they're essential for accessibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider the office filing cabinet: it organises information efficiently, but finding
      specific files still requires effort. Digital systems offer the same trade-offs. A good
      filing system might store 1/2 of your documents in frequently-accessed folders while
      archiving the remaining 3/4 for occasional reference. Thefficacy of any system depends
      on how well it fits your workflow.
    </p>

    <h2>Links: Regular vs SmartLink</h2>
    <p>
      In MDX content, markdown links automatically become <code>&lt;SmartLink&gt;</code> components.
      This paragraph uses regular <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags: here's an
      <a href="/notes/">internal link</a> and an
      <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">external link</a>.
      Notice you must manually add <code>target="_blank"</code> and <code>rel</code> for external links.
    </p>
    <p>
      This paragraph uses the <code>&lt;SmartLink&gt;</code> component instead. Here's an
      <SmartLink href="/notes/">internal link</SmartLink> and an
      <SmartLink href="https://github.com">external link</SmartLink>. SmartLink automatically
      detects external URLs, adds the arrow indicator, and handles <code>target</code>/<code>rel</code>
      attributes. It makes authoring content significantly easier.

  <!-- 2. Technical & Specialized Inline Elements -->
  <h3 id="technical-inline">Technical & Specialized Inline Elements</h3>
  <SGTypographySwitcher>
    <h2>Keyboard & Interface Patterns</h2>
    <p>
      Modern applications rely on keyboard shortcuts for efficient navigation. Press
      <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> to save, or <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>
      to open the command palette. On macOS, the <kbd>Option</kbd> key often reveals hidden
      functionality. These conventions emerged from the office software era and persist today.
    </p>
    <p>
      When documenting changes, use <del>deleted text</del> to show what was removed and
      <mark>highlighted text</mark> to draw attention to important updates. The <s>strikethrough</s>
      element (<code>&lt;s&gt;</code>) indicates content that's no longer accurate but remains
      for historical context, while <del>deletion</del> (<code>&lt;del&gt;</code>) marks actual
      removed content.
    </p>
    <h2>Scientific & Technical Notation</h2>
    <p>
      In scientific writing, superscripts and subscripts are essential. Water is written as
      H<sub>2</sub>O, while Einstein's famous equation is E = mc<sup>2</sup>. The <var>x</var>
      variable in f(<var>x</var>) = <var>x</var><sup>2</sup> + 2<var>x</var> + 1 represents
      any real number. When the command <samp>Build complete</samp> appears in your terminal,
      you know the process finished successfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      <small>Small print often contains legal disclaimers or supplementary information that
      doesn't warrant full-size text.</small> The book <cite>The Elements of Typographic Style</cite>
      by Robert Bringhurst remains the definitive reference for typography. As he notes,
      <q>Typography exists to honor content.</q>
    </p>
    <h2>Definitions & Abbreviations</h2>
    <p>
      A <dfn>design token</dfn> is a named entity that stores a visual design attribute.
      The <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> defines web standards, while
      <abbr>CSS</abbr> (no title attribute) handles styling. Notice how abbreviations with
      titles show a dotted underline indicating more information is available on hover.
    </p>
    <p>
      For emphasis beyond italics, use the <Highlight>highlight component</Highlight> to make
      text pop with a background colour. For formal titles and acronyms in running text,
      <SmallCaps>Small Caps</SmallCaps> provides a distinguished appearance that doesn't
      disrupt the flow of reading.

  <!-- 3. Headings (H1-H6) -->
  <h3 id="headings">Headings</h3>
  <SGTypographySwitcher>
    <h1>Finding Flow in Creative Work H1</h1>
    <p>
      The first-level heading establishes the primary topic. It should be used sparingly&mdash;typically
      once per page. In this example, we explore the art of finding flow in creative work,
      a topic that affects writers, designers, and developers alike.
    </p>

    <h2>The Office Environment H2</h2>
    <p>
      Second-level headings divide major sections. They're the workhorses of content structure,
      appearing frequently throughout longer documents. A good heading hierarchy helps readers
      navigate efficiently and understand the relationships between ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      The modern office has evolved significantly since the filing cabinet era. Open floor plans,
      remote work, and digital-first workflows have transformed how we collaborate. Yet the
      fundamental need for focused work time remains unchanged.
    </p>

    <h3>Efficient Filing Systems H3</h3>
    <p>
      Third-level headings break down subsections. They're useful for grouping related content
      within a major section. Here we might discuss specific strategies for organizing digital
      files or managing reference materials.
    </p>

    <h4>Configuring Default Folders H4</h4>
    <p>
      Fourth-level headings are less common but valuable for detailed technical content.
      In documentation, they might describe specific configuration options or step-by-step
      instructions within a larger procedure.
    </p>

    <h5>Affiliate Programme Details H5</h5>
    <p>
      Fifth-level headings rarely appear outside deeply nested documentation. When you find
      yourself reaching for <code>&lt;h5&gt;</code>, consider whether your content structure
      might benefit from reorganisation.
    </p>

    <h6>Sufficiently Deep Nesting H6</h6>
    <p>
      Sixth-level headings exist for completeness but suggest your document structure may be
      overly complex. Most content works well with three or four heading levels at most.
