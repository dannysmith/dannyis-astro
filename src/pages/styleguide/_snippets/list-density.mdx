A short-item list (should NOT get the class):

- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item

A long-item list where each item is essentially a paragraph (should get `.long-list-items`):

- When writing documentation, it's important to consider the reader's context and provide enough background information that they can understand the topic without needing to consult external resources.
- Code examples should be complete and runnable whenever possible, rather than showing isolated snippets that leave readers guessing about imports, configuration, or surrounding context.
- Error messages and edge cases deserve special attention because these are often the situations where readers most need guidance, yet they're frequently overlooked in favour of happy-path documentation.

A nested list where the outer items are short (nested content shouldn't affect the outer list):

- Setup requirements
  - This nested item is quite long and contains a lot of detail about the specific requirements for setting up the development environment, including all the tools and dependencies.
  - Another detailed nested item explaining configuration options and recommended settings for optimal performance.
- Installation steps
- Running tests
