Good writing often benefits from asides and references[^context]. Footnotes let you add depth without interrupting the main flow of your prose.

The footnote reference appears as a superscript number[^styling]. Clicking it can either jump to the footnotes section at the bottom, or—with the inline footnotes enhancement—show the content right below the current paragraph.

Multiple footnotes work naturally throughout a piece[^multiple]. They're particularly useful for citations, clarifications, or tangential[^multipara] thoughts that would otherwise break the reader's concentration.

[^context]: This is contextual information that supports the main point but isn't essential to understanding it. Footnotes keep your prose clean while still providing depth for curious readers.

[^styling]: The superscript styling uses small caps and the accent colour to make footnote references visually distinct but not distracting.

[^multipara]: Multiple footnotes in a single paragraph.

[^multiple]: You can have as many footnotes as you need. The numbering is handled automatically by the markdown processor.
