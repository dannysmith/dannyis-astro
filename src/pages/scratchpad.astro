        <h1>The Art of Web Typography</h1>
        <p>
          Good typography is invisible. When text is set well, readers don't notice the typeface,
          the line length, or the spacing—they simply absorb the content. This page demonstrates
          the typographic elements available on this site.
        </p>

        <h2>Inline Text Styles</h2>
        <p>
          Text can be emphasised in several ways. Use <strong>strong text</strong> for importance and
          <em>emphasis</em> for stress. You can also use <b>bold</b> and <i>italic</i> for stylistic
          purposes without semantic weight. For keyboard shortcuts, use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd
            >S</kbd
          > to save, or <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> on macOS.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inline <code>code snippets</code> appear in a monospace font. Links like
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org">MDN Web Docs</a> provide navigation to other resources.
          You can also mark text as <ins>inserted</ins> or <del>deleted</del>, which is useful for
          showing edits. The <mark>mark element</mark> highlights text for reference.
        </p>
        <p>
          Abbreviations can include titles: <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and
          <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> are the building blocks of the web. Some
          abbreviations like <abbr>NASA</abbr> or <abbr>ASAP</abbr> are common enough to stand alone.
        </p>
        <p>Short paragraph. Sometimes you need just a sentence or two.</p>
        <p>
          Scientific notation uses subscript and superscript: H<sub>2</sub>O is water, and
          Einstein's famous equation is E = mc<sup>2</sup>. Footnotes often use superscript<sup
            >1</sup
          > as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <u>underline element</u> should be used sparingly as it can be confused with links. The
          <small>small element</small> represents side comments and small print.
        </p>

        <h2>Headings Hierarchy</h2>
        <p>
          Headings create document structure. Each level should be used semantically, not for
          styling. Below is a demonstration of all heading levels in context.
        </p>

        <h3>Third-Level Heading</h3>
        <p>
          This is body text following an H3. Third-level headings work well for subsections within
          a larger topic. They provide enough visual distinction without overwhelming the reader.
        </p>

        <h4>Fourth-Level Heading</h4>
        <p>
          Fourth-level headings are useful for detailed breakdowns. They're common in technical
          documentation and long-form articles where deep nesting is necessary.
        </p>

        <h5>Fifth-Level Heading</h5>
        <p>
          At this level, headings become quite subtle. They're rarely needed but exist for
          completeness.
        </p>

        <h6>Sixth-Level Heading</h6>
        <p>
          The smallest heading level. If you need this many levels of hierarchy, consider
          restructuring your content.
        </p>

        <h2>Lists</h2>
        <p>Lists organise related items. They come in ordered and unordered varieties.</p>

        <h3>Unordered Lists</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>First item at the top level</li>
          <li>
            Second item with nested content
            <ul>
              <li>Nested item one</li>
              <li>
                Nested item two with further nesting
                <ul>
                  <li>Deeply nested item</li>
                  <li>Another deeply nested item</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Nested item three</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Third item back at the top level</li>
          <li>
            Fourth item with a longer description that might wrap to multiple lines depending on
            the viewport width
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Ordered Lists</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C</li>
          <li>
            Prepare the ingredients:
            <ol>
              <li>Measure 200g of flour</li>
              <li>Weigh 100g of butter</li>
              <li>
                Gather the spices:
                <ol>
                  <li>1 tsp cinnamon</li>
                  <li>½ tsp nutmeg</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Mix dry ingredients together</li>
          <li>Add wet ingredients gradually</li>
          <li>Bake for 25 minutes</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Blockquotes</h2>
        <p>Quotations deserve distinct styling to set them apart from the author's voice.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The details are not the details. They make the design. Good design is as little design
            as possible—less, but better, because it concentrates on the essential aspects.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Longer quotations can span multiple paragraphs:</p>

            Typography is the craft of endowing human language with a durable visual form. It is a
            craft with ancient roots, but one that has been transformed repeatedly by
            technological change.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the digital age, typography has become both more accessible and more complex.
            Anyone can set type, but setting it well requires understanding principles developed
            over centuries.
          </p>

        <h2>Code Blocks</h2>
        <p>Longer code samples use preformatted blocks:</p>
        <pre><code>function greet(name) &#123;
  return `Hello, $&#123;name&#125;!`;
&#125;

console.log(greet('World'));</code></pre>

        <h2>Putting It Together</h2>
        <p>
          Real content rarely uses every element in isolation. A typical paragraph might mention
          that the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> published the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/">HTML5.2 specification</a> in 2017, note that browsers
          render <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> as a block element, and remind readers to press
          <kbd>F12</kbd> to open developer tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          Typography matters because it affects comprehension. Studies show that well-set text
          improves reading speed by 10–20%. Bad typography, meanwhile, creates <em>friction</em
          >—readers struggle without knowing why. The goal isn't decoration; it's <strong
            >communication</strong
          >. Consider how line length affects readability: too short and the eye jumps constantly,
          breaking rhythm; too long and readers lose their place when moving to the next line. The
          ideal measure sits somewhere between 45 and 75 characters, though context matters
          enormously. A novel might push toward the upper end, while a mobile interface demands
          brevity. Then there's line height, which must balance density against legibility.
          Cramped lines blur together; overly loose ones fragment into isolated strips. The
          interplay between typeface, size, weight, and spacing forms a complex system where
          changing one variable ripples through all the others. A heavier weight might demand more
          line height. A larger size might tolerate tighter tracking. These decisions compound
          across hundreds of paragraphs, thousands of headings, and millions of characters.
          Consistency becomes paramount—not rigid uniformity, but a coherent system that readers
          internalise without conscious effort. When everything works, the typography disappears
          entirely. Readers see only ideas, stories, arguments, instructions. They feel informed
          or moved or persuaded, never once thinking about the letters on the screen. That
          invisibility is the highest achievement of typographic craft, and it requires obsessive
          attention to details that most people will never notice.
