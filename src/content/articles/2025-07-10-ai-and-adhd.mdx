My friend Vicki's "mate have you considered maybe youse got ADHD" was the first time I remember this topic coming up. That was maybe six years back, and I promptly forgot about it. Then, two years ago – while ADHD was all the rage on TikTok – my friend Janina had a period of revalation about herself and made me do a bunch of tests. Turns out I probably have Adult ADHD.

I read a couple of things this week which started me thinking about ADHD. And I'm thinking about AI because in June of 2025 it's hard to avoid. This 2024 piece from Schneems is a response to DHHs [rant](https://web.archive.org/web/20241121071802/https://world.hey.com/dhh/cold-reading-an-adhd-affliction-44163793) about ADHD.

He makes a lot of good points, but two bits cracked me up in relation to myself...

> My biggest behavioral issue was that I snuck books into class and read them under my desk. If your mental picture of someone with ADHD is an out-of-control “little monster,” then this seems like the opposite. I got through college with a degree, taught myself Ruby on Rails

I also snuck books into school to read under the desk. One teacher gave me a detention for it but others brought me _really interesting_ books from home (and in one case a giant stack of New Scientist magazines) and occasionally let me get away with reading _over_ the desk instead of doing whatever work I was supposed to be interested in. I also got through university with a degree and taught myself Ruby on Rails.

> One day, I was having an argument with my wife. It was about how I never planned dates. It got heated. She had to go to a meeting, and I planned to return to the conversation “Hey, how about we grab lunch after your meeting to talk it over.” I realized that I needed to meet the basic expectations of planning events and trying to compensate for them by taking action then and there. The suggestion might seem trite or pandering, but she thought it was good and agreed.
>
> An hour later, she walked into my office (garage), and I literally couldn’t remember why she was there. Or rather, I was in the middle of another task, and when she walked in, I had to rack my brain to quickly retrieve the info that would provide context to her: “I’m here.” It took a split second too long, and she noticed. Turns out that I don’t “have a good memory.” What I have is the ability to recall extremely detailed information about a situation, given that I’m primed with the context.

I laughed out loud at this. In the two years since Janina made me do those tests, we've laughed a lot at how differently this stuff affects each of us. The venn diagram of our symptoms barely overlaps. What Schneems describes here is not a thing for her at all, but it very much is for me. We live together, so she's seen (and been frustrated by) versions of this _a lot_ over the years. So also have a lot of my girlfriends. And collegues. And friends.

The last sentence is a wonderfully concise version of something I've always struggled to explain about myself: _"What I have is the ability to recall extremely detailed information about a situation, given that I’m primed with the context."_

I also stumbled upon this wonderfully creative site (which reminded me of the web back in the olden days)

When I'd stopped puzzling over how this was possibly made with Wix, I read over the list of symptoms. It's the first time for two years I've read through a list like this and I chuckled at how many describe me. I've circled those which I definitely experience (and I'm sure my friends would recognise!)

<Callout>
  Over the last 20 years I've developed **extremely good** mechanisms for dealing with many of these
  symptoms (without which I'd have circled *everything* above bar about four). I also have fairly
  good mechanisms for a lot of those I circled, but not yet to the extent that they no longer affect
  me.

## Me and ADAD

When ADHD was all over TikTok, friends were prodding me about getting a formal diagnosis. I didn't seek one because knowing whether I _Have ADHD_ or not wasn't **useful to me**, and still isn't.

Most people I know, when faced with mountains of evidence that _you very obviously have ADHD_, reacted with some version of "OMG this explains soooo much, this is really helpful to understand". And for many it **absolutely** has been.

My own reaction was one of mild interest. Because while _"you very obviously have ADHD"_ was news to me, **not one of the symtoms was**. I've always held the view that these "symptoms" were just kinda _how my brain is_. Sure, they make me super-shit at a bung of things, but they also make weirdly great at other things. Whether I like it or not, they're how my brain is. And always has been.

This muted reaction is partly because I've been an accidental stoic from a young age – I've always thought it insane to try to control the uncontriollable. Things are how they are and unless we can **actually** change them, and if we can't it's better to embrace reality and look for what we can change. I can no more control the symptoms I circled above than I can my emotions. But I can control how I **respond** to them.

I realised years ago that my brain was a bit weird. I also realised that any attempt to fndamentally change it was utterly exhausting, felt turbo-shit, and – most importantly – **didn't work at all**. And if I couldn't change how my brain worked, the only sensible response was to happily accept reality, and focus on useful things I **could change**.

Which is why I read Getting Things Done as a weed-smoking seventeen-year-old: I had some vague notion that I couldn't rely on my brain to stay organised. All my mates thought this was very weird. When – like most folks who read it – I failed to stick to the "GTD Way" for more than a minute, I took the bits that **actually helped me** and left the rest. And I've kinda been doing that ever since.

The result is: I'm self-employed, work remotely for multiple clients and intentionally avoid anything requiring a fixed 9-5 or Mon-Fri schedule. I write **everything** down immediatly, lest it's gone when my mental context changes 10 seconds later. Every time-based thing goes straight in my calendar, which is always with me. I own an Apple Watch specifically to poke me when I have meetings. I've internalised a bunch of habits which keep my physical space tidy without the need to focus on it. I have hard rules to avoid impulse purchases and hasty big decisions (fundamentally: "always sleep on it"). _I could go on like this..._

The point is: I've been finding out how to work _well_ with my own brain for decades. Far from being exhausting, the kinda stuff above is **liberating** and **feels easy**. Figuring this stuff out, however, is often _not_ easy. But the hard work is always the **figuring out**, not the sustained doing. Because if sustained doing is hard, I haven't figured it out yet.

Weather you have ADHD or not, finding ways to work **with** your brain rather than _against_ it will never be a bad thing. And after working heavily with AI for the last few months, I have some embryonic thoughts...

## AI & ADHD

### 1️⃣ Assistants

- Recording meeting notes and extracting. No split focus.

### 2 Rolling Context

With so many things going on, AI can help make sense of them and remind me of my priorities.
I can side-quest for an hour until I get bored and pick up easily afterwards.

### 3 Agents

I can kick off multiple unrelated tasks and flit between them while AI does the work in the background. In this case, the tendancy to context-shift between multiple things becomes an advantage.
