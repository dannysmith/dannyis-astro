## The Goal

- background on me
- My goals

### Rules of the Game

- Hand-code < 1% of the code

## The Product

## AI Toolchain

### 1️⃣ Claude Code
The main driver.
- Context7
- Playwright


### 2️⃣ Cursor
Switched from VSCode to Cursor a while back. Their Auto "model" is awful, but the tab completion is useful when hand-editing and (with claude sonnet) the sidebar is useful for the occasional quick query. I could easily have done this with VSCode tho.

### 3️⃣ Gemini Code
- Large context window
- Reviews and planning to feed to Claude

### 4️⃣ Claude Desktop
- Used for initial research on tech choices. Fed output into Claude Code. Didn't really use beyond the initial planning tho.

### 5️⃣ ChatGPT
Used to generate app icons only.

### 6️⃣ Wispr Flow
Dictation which works.

## Getting Started

I started by creating an empty repo and dictating my thoughts into a markdown doc.

# So how'd it go?

## Fast as Fuck

## Learned a Lot by Watching



# Practical Advice

## Start With A Solid Walking Skeleton

- Why I one-shotted
- See lol issue
- Establish core patterns early
- Fucking State Management

## Iterate with a structured process

1. Plan
	- Dictate your requirements into a markdown doc
    - Have AI reserach best approaches
    - Have AI build a god technical plan
2. Execute
	- Have AI work through the plan and stop after each phase.
    - Ask AI to review its work and ensure conformity with your `architecture.md` doc.
    - Manually test and work with AI to fix any issues one at a time.
    - Have it run some `check:all` script which typechecks, lints, formats all code and runs all tests.
3. Clean up
   - At the end of each feature, ask AI to clean up any comments, logs etc.
   - Have AI document any new patterns in the simplest way possible and update CLAUDE.md as needed.

## Think about context ahead of time

- Compact
- Clear
- Write out to file
- 

## Don't be scared to do ad-hoc things
