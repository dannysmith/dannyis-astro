title: How I'm Using Obsidian in December 2025

I kinda hate Obsidian. And I'm moving all my stuff to Obsidian. I wanna briefly explain both those statements before I start nerding out about my obsidian setup.

## A spot of historical context

Between 2010 and 2018ish I wrote pretty much **eveything** in Markdown using either a text editor or [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) because (github-flavoured) markdown is a *ludicrously excellent* markup language, and back then GitHub was a legitimately good solution for managing large collections of documents without loosing your mind. And also I was a programmer, so obvs.

And then I found Notion, which in 2018 was pretty basic. But it felt similar to the markdown-on-github knowledge management I was used to, except the bloke designing it was Johnny Ive not Linus Torvalds.

Despite the recent feature bloat & AI-all-the-things-with-a-shoehorn, Notion was (and still is) a rare feat of design for me. It's an *actual* general purpose tool which is genuinely valuable, useable **and enjoyed by** people who normally hate computers AND power-users who. Which is pretty fucking unusual. I've introduced Notion to a bunch of companies over the last ~6 years and I think it's the only bit of "enterprise" software which kinda Just Works if it's rolled out right.

<Callout>I gotta say it: Notion were awesome because they consistently met their users *actual* needs, not their wants. Bar one or two little things, Notion was feature-complete **finished software** for me by 2023/4. And good, finished software which sells well enterprise and (man-loyal) consumers tends to be lucrative in the long-run... so long as your finished thing remains better than that of your competitors. Which Notion 💯 was/is - can you imagine Google or Microsoft or Amazon or Apple doing better at Notion at Notion? So what did Notion do... **jumped on the AI bandwaggon, obviously** </Callout>

## Do I really hate Obsidian?

I hate how it feels. Perhaps I haven't got my setup right yet, but that even being a possibility is one of the things I hate. By default, Obsidian's interface is unintuitive and overly-complex. It feels like an app designed for power-users who enjoy fiddling with settings and want infinite customizability, and the myriad  even-more-confusing-and-ugly community plugins are even worse. Nothing seems to *Just Work*, or work as expected. Even Obsidian's CEO [Steph](https://stephango.com/) had to build a [theme and three plugins](https://minimal.guide/home) to make it nicer.

I can't really blame Obsidian for this though. It's super-hard to make an everything-to-everyone general-purpose tool which is infinitely extensible and can only ever store data as files on disk.

Perhaps I just need to get used to it.

## So why the move?



1. When I spent most of my time at work in Notion, there was a big advantage in using it for personal stuff too. I now spend a lot more time working with local text files.
