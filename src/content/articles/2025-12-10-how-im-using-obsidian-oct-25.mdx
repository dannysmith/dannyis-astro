I kinda hate Obsidian. And I'm moving all my stuff to Obsidian. I wanna explain both those statements before I start nerding out about my *Obsidian setup*.

## A spot of historical context

Between 2010(ish) and 2018(ish) I wrote pretty much **eveything** in Markdown using a text editor, because (github-flavoured) markdown is a *ludicrously excellent* markup language for words and (back then) GitHub was a legitimately good solution for managing large collections of words without loosing your mind. And also I was a programmer, so obvs.

And then I found Notion. In 2018 Notion was pretty basic: it felt similar to the markdown-on-github knowledge management I was used to, except the bloke designing it was Johnny Ive not Linus.

Despite the recent feature bloat & AI-all-the-things-with-a-shoehorn, Notion was (and still is) a rare feat of design for me. It's an *actual* general purpose tool which is genuinely valuable, useable **and enjoyed by** people who normally hate computers AND the power-users who nerd out on overly complex system design. Which is pretty fucking unusual. I've introduced Notion to a bunch of companies over the last ~6 years and I think it's the only bit of "enterprise" software which kinda Just Works *(if it's rolled out right)*.

<Callout>I gotta say it: Notion were awesome because they consistenyl met their users *actual* needs, not their wants. Bar one or two little things, Notion would've been feature-complete **finished software** for me by 2023/4. And good, finished software which sells well enterprise and (man-loyal) consumers tends to be lucrative in the long-run... so long as your finished thing remains better than that of your competitors. Which Notion 💯 was/is - can you imagine Google or Microsoft or Amazon or Apple doing better at Notion's thing than Notion? It's just not their thing. And what did notion do... **compete with OpenAI and Anthropic and Google and build their own AI chat** </Callout>
