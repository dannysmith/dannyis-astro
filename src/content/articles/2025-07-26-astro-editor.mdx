[From userguide]

[Briefly: why now?]

[Summarise: I've wantedthis for ages. AI made is possible]

## Arriving at 1.0.0

- My definition of 1.0.0

- First public release
- Super useful feedback: schemas not like mine
  - Use gemerated JSON - starlight sites et al
  - Subfolders
  - More resiliant schema parsing
  - Zod References
  - Astro Image helper
  - Nested schemas
  - Image previews
  - Project & collection-specific overrides
  - And more
  - macOs univerals

## Still reading?

If you have an Astro site and use a mac, help me out by giving Astro Editor a try. *(If you don't use a mac, bear with me - I'm working on it!)*

Perfect Case: Astro Editor is so damm nice you spend the next `n` years writing & publishing every day.

More Realistic Best Case: it *Just Works* and in six months' you can't remember reading this article but still reach for Astro Editor when you wanna write something.

Worst case: you take the time to download & install and it won't even open your site properly. Or it's more confusing than VSCode. Or crashes all the time. Or whatever.

**My best case** is arriving at a the point where those last things *never* happen, and I'm blissfully unaware that a bunch of people are enjoying & sharing their writing because they're using Astro Editor.

But I obviously can't get there on my own. I need feedback. I need people to:

- Open sites in Astro Editor and tell me if something breaks.
- Use Astro Editor and report any bugs, wierdness or suggestions.
- **Really write** in Astro Editor and tell me how it *feels* as a writer.
- Even: Install and then abandon Astro Editor (feedback re this *why* is always fucking golden, every time).

All of which means the thing I need most of all is **Astro people installing Astro Editor** and giving it 20 minutes or so. And since I'm turbo-shit at any kind of marketing and you've read this far, my request to you is...

Help me by **sharing Astro Editor with everyone who might possibly be interested in using it.** 🙏


## Future Plans

Astro Editor is prettymuch feature-complete formy needs, and absent feedback to the contrary it seems to work well for a pretty wide set of Astro sites.

After years working on VC-funded projects that (by definition) can never be "finished", it's weirdly thrilling to point at a product that's ~6 months' old and say "yeah it might be kinda feature-complete?".

That said, I do still have some biggish jobs on the [roadmap](https://github.com/users/dannysmith/projects/5):

1. Windows support
2. Linux support
3. Easy linking to other content (a la Obsidian `[[`)
