The UK Government Digital Service (GDS) has created something special with [gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/). Moving away from skeuomorphic design trends, they've focused on content-first, accessible design that makes government information truly usable.

As John Gruber noted about skeuomorphic design:

> "On retina displays... these techniques are revealed for what they truly are: an assortment of parlor tricks"

The GDS approach demonstrates that good design doesn't need visual tricks. Instead, it comes from:

- **Content-focused layout** that prioritizes information over decoration
- **Thoughtful typography** including their excellent adaptation of the Transport typeface
- **Accessibility** ensuring government services work for everyone
- **Flat design** that focuses on usability rather than visual effects

Andy Budd's observation rings true here:

> "The best designers and developers rarely have more talent. They simply have more time."

This echoes Teller's insight about magic:

> "Sometimes magic is just someone spending more time on something than anyone else might reasonably expect."

The gov.uk website succeeds because the team invested time in getting the fundamentals right: clear typography, logical information architecture, and user-centered design principles.

Good design, it turns out, is less about flashy effects and more about well-designed content, typography, and layoutâ€”combined with the time to experiment and refine until everything works seamlessly together.
