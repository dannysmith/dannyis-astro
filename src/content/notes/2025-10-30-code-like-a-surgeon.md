- Surgical metaphor for programming: slow setup, deliberate incisions, clean sutures, zero surprises in recovery.
- Highlights tooling rituals (checklists, monitors, pair support) that keep changes controlled rather than chaotic heroics.
- Inspires me to document pre-flight checklists for risky refactors so I stop improvising under pressure.
