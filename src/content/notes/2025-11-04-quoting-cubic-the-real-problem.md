> How the best teams avoid comprehension debt The best teams I've seen solve this problem before any code gets written.
>
> They spend significant time planning with the AI upfront. Not just giving it a prompt and accepting whatever comes back. But going back and forth on the high-level approach. Thinking through edge cases together. Shaping the implementation before a single line gets generated.
>
> This isn't about slowing down. It's about understanding what you're building.
>
> When you shape the implementation with the AI, two things happen:
>
> First, the AI writes better code. Because you've given it more context, thought through the edge cases, and guided it toward a cleaner architecture.
>
> But second, and this is more important, the human engineer actually understands the code. Because they shaped it. They made the key decisions. The AI just handled the mechanical work of typing it out.
