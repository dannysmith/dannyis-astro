> I had Claude resurface texts I forgot to respond to, and realized that the real blocker—obviously—was that I didn’t want to reply. I’ve tried countless apps to shut out distractions, but procrastinate just as well by staring blankly at walls.

When you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail; when you can conjure solutions at will, you won’t stop to ponder why you built them.
