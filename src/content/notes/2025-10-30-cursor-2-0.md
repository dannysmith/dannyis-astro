- Cursor relaunch leans into full-stack agent workflows: local-first editing, auto context sync, and Copilot-style plans.
- Interesting positioning as "AI pair" that toggles between chat, edits, and diff previews rather than a monolithic chat box.
- Worth benchmarking against my current VS Code + Claude setup to see if the new review loops shrink iteration time.
