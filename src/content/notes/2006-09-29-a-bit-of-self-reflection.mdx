Sometimes it's a good idea to sit down and just think. I did just that the other day and as my mind wandered I started thinking about what I'm good at – what I like doing. It struck me that I should try to push my aspirations and ideas towards these things.

So here are some of my thoughts, in a simple old-fashioned list. No Waffle:

- I'm good at making things neat and tidy.
- I like procedure, order and outlines.
- I like documents that follow conventions. My conventions.
- I like implementing systems which are written down in detail.
- I like designing paperwork, but not using other peoples.
- I like stationary. A lot.
- I like being outdoors and doing visual, manual work.
- I like pretty things – stuff that is clean and functional, but looks nice too.
- I like structures and schedules.
- I like teaching, an awful lot.
- I'm good at writing detailed plans & orders.
- I *enjoy* writing documentation.
- I like talking.
- I like meta-stuff

Writing these down just now was a rather enlightening experience. It seems I'm rather a perfectionist, at least when it comes to paperwork and organization. It's all rather at odds to my fairly laid-back attitude to things. I guess I'm a secret perfectionist.
