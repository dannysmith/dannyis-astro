Over the last few weeks I've been using a nifty little web service called YubNub, it's basically a command line for the web and while it's not as astounding as it might sound it does make it a little easier to do certain things, especially from the search bar within firefox. I use it all the time – so much, in fact, that I'd really like to be able to use it from the desktop...

Enter [Yahoo! Widget Engine](http://widgets.yahoo.com/) (catchy name, no?).

Except nobody's made a widget for yubNub yet, strange considering how easy it is to create a simple search widget. To fix this chronic lack of yubnubwidgetness I've whipped together a simple search widget called **YubNubi**. Maybe one day I'll add some crazy functionality to it but at the moment, all it does is search. Plain and Simple. You type your query or command in the box, hit enter and yubnub will execute the command and display the results in your default browser.

The widget is at version 1.2 at the moment and you can get it [from the widget gallery](http://widgets.yahoo.com/gallery/view.php?widget=37928).

After the first release I made a few changes to it – I added an about screen and different graphics and tidied up the code a little. Shortly after it gained the .2 the it was [announced on the yubnub blog](http://yubnub.blogspot.com/2005/12/yubnub-konfabulator-widget-by-danny.html).

So, If you're into YubNub and use the Yahoo Widget Engine, go ahead and have a look.
