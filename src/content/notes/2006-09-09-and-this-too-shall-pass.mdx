Attributed by some to Abraham Lincoln and others to the Kung Foo masters, the phrase "And this too shall pass" appeared in the Bible, engraved on a ring given to Solomon.

What a wonderful way of dealing with both bad and good times – It reminds me that the happiness I have is fragile and could disappear at any time, motivating me to work to keep it. It also gives me hope when I strike bad times – knowing that they will pass does a wonderful job of raising the spirits.

> "And this too shall pass"

Always remember it.
