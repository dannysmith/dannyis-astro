I found Matt's website today and had a lovely couple of hours exploring his writing.

I love most of his 15 [Rules for Blogging](https://interconnected.org/home/2020/09/10/streak), but this one in particular...

> One idea per post. If I find myself launching into another section, cut and paste the extra into a separate draft post, and tie off the original one with the word “Anyway.” Then publish.

I regularly get excited enough to write a kinda-strem-of-conciousness thought down which turns out to be half-decent **except for the end**. And these often languish as drafts for ages for want of a neat way to wrap them up.

I just looked at my unfnished drafts and about two thirds of them are hard to wrap up because they contain multiple kinda-related ideas which are _just a bit too hard_ to bring together in a conculsion I'm happy with.

Anyway.
