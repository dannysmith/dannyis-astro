Interesting analogy here with compilers. We're able to build good software without reading assembly - we just trust that they work well. (And having written some assembly as a student I've very glad we can)

I can certainally get on board with the idea that **eventually** LLMs will be able to abstract away implementation details (ie code) in a similar way that my current tooling abstracts away machine code.

But making compilers sufficiently reliable for peogrammers to trust them took an awful lot of time and effort, and unlike LLMs they're sufficiently deterministic that well-designed tests and benchmarks are a reliable measure of consistent behavuour & performance.
