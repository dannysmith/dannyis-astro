A little while ago I bought a [Caldigit Thunderbolt 4 Dock](https://www.caldigit.com/thunderbolt-station-4/) to connect my M2 Macbook Pro to my monitors and peripherals. After struggling to get a decent signal to my monitor I eventually shelled out Â£130 on [this cable](https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MN713ZM/A/thunderbolt-4-usb%E2%80%91c-pro-cable-18m) from Apple, which fixed things but seemd **crazy expensive for a 2m cable**.

After watching this video on the internals of Apple's cable, I can see why it cost so much... **it has more compute power than Appolo 11**.
