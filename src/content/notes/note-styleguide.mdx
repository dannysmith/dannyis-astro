This styleguide demonstrates how all key Markdown/MDX features, Astro components, and prose styles render in a Note context. Use it to check typography, component appearance, and real-world content. For a full component reference, see the [main styleguide](/styleguide/).

## Accordion

<Accordion header="Collapsible Note Section">
  Perfect for organizing supplementary information in notes. This accordion contains:

- **Quick facts** that don't need to be immediately visible
- Reference links and resources
- Technical details or implementation notes
- Optional reading materials

Great for keeping notes concise while providing depth when needed.

</Accordion>

<Accordion header="Usage in Notes">
  Use accordions in notes to:
  
  1. Hide lengthy technical details
  2. Organize optional context
  3. Provide expandable examples
  4. Keep the main content focused

```mdx
<Accordion header="Details">Hidden content here...</Accordion>
```

</Accordion>

  emphasis_.

### The Art of Typography

Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and appealing when displayed. The arrangement of type involves selecting typefaces, point sizes, line lengths, line-spacing (leading), and letter-spacing (tracking), and adjusting the space between pairs of letters (kerning).

The term typography is also applied to the style, arrangement, and appearance of the letters, numbers, and symbols created by the process. Type design is a closely related craft, sometimes considered part of typography; most typographers do not design typefaces, and some type designers do not consider themselves typographers.
