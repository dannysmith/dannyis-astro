> When a billion people have access to advanced AI, we've entered what we might call the era of Mass Intelligence. Every institution we have — schools, hospitals, courts, companies, governments — was built for a world where intelligence was scarce and expensive.

How do we preserve what's valuable about human expertise while democratizing access to knowledge?
