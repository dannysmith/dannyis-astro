A few months ago It struck me that I use a lot of web based software and there's a bunch of my stuff published online somewhere. "Somewhere" – that's the problem, my photo's are on flickr, my bookmarks on del.icio.us, my writing on one or two different blogs and a bunch of other stuff is elsewhere.

[SuprGlue](http://spruglu.com/) is a nice little service which provides a means for you to clump all of your online social activities together. Right now it syndicates my photos at flickr, my bookmarks at del.icio.us, my things at 43things, my music at Last.fm, my events at upandcomming.org and my writing on this and my old blog.

SuprGlu then displays all my activity across these services for an individual day. It's a pretty simple concept really.

The [Iridesco](http://www.iridesco.com/05/project-suprglu.php) website describes SuprGlu:

> SuprGlu is a simple online tool for users to gather the disparate content they've contributed to the social web. Users are able to "stick" together their blogs, bookmarks, photos, and other personal breadcrumbs they leave around the web, and share their neatly chronicled online lives on their SuprGlu pages.

Although I don't much like any of the templates available you're given the opportunity to edit the CSS for your page in the SuprGlu admin panel.

You can find [my SuprGlue page here](http://blu3zirux.suprglu.com/).
