I spent some time today putting together a new business card. I found myself pondering quite what to put on them, as they're more multi-use than your regular biz card because I don't have a business/job to promote - at least not a specific one.

I seem to be asked for business cards by three groups of people: those who want my contact details relating to my work in the Air Training Corps, those interested in my web design and those who want to get in touch with me regarding my music. (I'm forever being asked what my myspace address is by the latter.)

In the end I decided to just stick with my name, email address, website and phone number so that the card could be as multi-purpose as possible - I suppose it's more typical of the old fashioned "calling cards", albeit with a little more information.

Along with my name, the circles at the bottom are meant to suggest an acoustic guitar, at least that's the intention! I've also made the email address (and specifically the [at] symbol) quite prominent to suggest a technology connection. The blank space on the left allows me to write any details which aren't on the card - my address or ATC Squadron number, for instance.

So, without further ado, here's the initial design:
