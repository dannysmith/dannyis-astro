So the Second round of GTD-inspired stuff happened this morning. There's not much to explain here really, except that I've just gone through all of my reference materials and condensed & sorted them.

On looking at each piece of paper or folder I asked the following questions:

1. Will I need to look at this again?
2. If so, can the information be better stored electronically
3. If not, does it need archiving?
4. Is it in the most appropriate folder?
5. If not, where should it go? What should the folder be called?

What I ended up with was a bloody great pile of stuff to bin, a small pile of stuff to shred or burn, a small pile of stuff to file at cadets and a surprisingly tiny set of nicely labeled file folders in alphabetical order, filling less than half of one file drawer. Cool. here it is:

While sifting, sorting and scrapping I was reminded of one or two things I should be doing and these duly went into OmniFocus via the (pretty cool) quick entry box. There were duly made into projects and, if they had paper stuff, were given file folders too.

## Project Front Sheets

The next stage in my journey to sort shit out involved defining outcomes, ideas, constraints and what not for all of the major projects I've got going. It's worth noting here that these only apply to *major* projects. All the smaller projects that are simply a reaction to life aren't worth worrying about.

Below is the sheet I use for defining projects. I knocked it up the other day after reading the section on project planning in GTD. Let me know what you think of it.
