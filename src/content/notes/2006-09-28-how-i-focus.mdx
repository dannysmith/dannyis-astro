After reading someone's blog the other day (I seem to have lost the link) I made a note to look into the ways in which I focus. As a student I've all sorts of (mostly pleasant) things to distract me from my work and after a bit of thinking it seems I force myself to focus by using the following tricks:

- **Inboxes** – I carry a Notebook in my bag and some index cards in my pocket for scribbling down anything which comes into my head. I've a big inbox on my desk and an inbox folder on my laptop to collect these ideas and thoughts. Doing this keeps my head clear.

- **Sound canceling headphones** – I use these when working in the Library at college or when I'm in a public place trying to do something.

- **Listen to music** – I listen to either calm repetitive "Easy Listening" music, or some good classical stuff. Anything else and I get too involved in listening to it.

- **Close Applications** – I close every application except iTunes, Minuteur, kGTD and the app I'm working in.

- **Fresh Air** – I keep a window open, which not only circulates fresh air but keeps the room at a pretty cool temperature.

- **Drink tea, drink water.** – I drink plenty of water (2ltrs per day) and I always have a pot of Chinese tea by me when I'm working. It helps me think. (A cup of caffeinated tea is a good way to wake me up if I'm a little groggy.)

- **Take regular breaks** – I take time out to sit, smoke and think about what I'm doing.

- **Compete** – I make sure I compete with myself. Dave Seah's PCEO works well for that. I also have my own system for judging how well I'm doing today.

So, how do you focus on the task in hand?
