This is an interesting read. 

> 27% of Claude-assisted work consists of tasks that wouldn't have been done otherwise

This is one of the huge advantages of LLMs for me.

> Most employees use Claude frequently while reporting they can “fully delegate” 0-20% of their work to it. Claude is a constant collaborator but using it generally involves active supervision and validation, especially in high-stakes work—versus handing off tasks requiring no verification at all.

This is also good to see in a report from an AI company like Anthropic. Far too many folks are hailing Agentic AI as a death knell for engineers. But this chimes with my experience, and if Anthropic themselves are still working like this I think we can safely say "nope" to that one.

The full article is worth a read.
