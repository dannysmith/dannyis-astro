This reminds me so much of the old UK MoD File Reference system (some of which is still in [JSP 441](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a82b0d240f0b62305b93d65/2017-02121.pdf)!)

I feel like systems such as these might have even more relevance in the age of LLMs, because they allow content and structures to be understood and referenced through a logical text-based system of symbols.
