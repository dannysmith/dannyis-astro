I recently added a little feature to articles and notes on this site to make things easier to share. At the bottom of every article and note, there are three links:

1. **Share** - uses the browsers [Web Share API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/share) to open a share-sheet.
2. **Copy as markdown** - copies the content of the article/note as markdown
3. **View as markdown** - opens the current URL with an `.md` extension which returns the above with `Content-Type: text/markdown;`

Thanks to tools like Claude Code, I'm finding myself working more and more with markdown, so it makes sense for me to make any content I write available in that format too.

You can try these out on this note ↓
