Tim Feriss' [5 Bullet Friday](https://go.tim.blog/5-bullet-friday-1/) today included this quote...

> To roughly paraphrase my friend, who’s a fan of minimalist packing, “I would rather have one pair of footwear that does everything well enough than carry a bunch of specialist footwear that does things better than I need.” We both only brought carry-on luggage.

This is exactly how I think about my own kit when I travel, or head out hiking. But it's also how I often thing about the design of systems, processes and software tools. With the latter, "well enough" is often a high bar and so requires a bunch of specialist software. But wherever something we already have is _good enough_, stick with it until it isn't.
