It's amazing how a lack of self-confidence in one area of your life can quickly transcend and affect various others.

A few weeks ago I was rather unhappy and lost confidence in myself with regard to certain areas of my life. I found that while I was still as able to, for example, lead cadets, my confidence in myself to do this rapidly diminished, as a result of my other problems. This caused me to appear shy which did in fact impact on my ability to lead. The same, of course, is true in reverse – as I've gained confidence in myself in certain areas I've gained it in others.

So the moral of the story? Don't lose faith in yourself and use areas you're confident in to help you with those you're not. And watch out for the downward spiral leading to total lack of belief in yourself.
