I just found some cool numbers you can use if you're on O2 in the UK - these apply to most iPhone users and could be useful.

- Call `**61*NUMBER*11*TIME#` (where TIME is the number of seconds to ring for before forwarding and NUMBER is the number to divert to). So to divert to voicemail after 30 seconds you'd call `**61*901*11*30#`.
- Call `*#61#` for current status of call forwarding when you're busy/don't answer.
- Call `**62*` to activate call forwarding when you're not reachable (`##62#` to cancel)
- Call `**21*NUMBER#` to divert all calls to NUMBER. Calling `##21#` cancels this.

A number of my mates divert their mobile calls to their office phones while they're at their desks. You could easily set up two contacts:

- "Set office divert ON" - `**21*YOUR_OFFICE_NUMBER#`
- "Set office divert OFF" - `##21#`

You can find more general information about these codes online.
