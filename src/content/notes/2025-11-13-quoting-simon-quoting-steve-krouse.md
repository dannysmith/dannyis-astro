> The fact that MCP is a difference surface from your normal API allows you to ship MUCH faster to MCP. This has been unlocked by inference at runtime
> 
> Normal APIs are promises to developers, because developer commit code that relies on those APIs, and then walk away. If you break the API, you break the promise, and you break that code. This means a developer gets woken up at 2am to fix the code
> 
> But MCP servers are called by LLMs which dynamically read the spec every time, which allow us to constantly change the MCP server. It doesn't matter! We haven't made any promises. The LLM can figure it out afresh every time
