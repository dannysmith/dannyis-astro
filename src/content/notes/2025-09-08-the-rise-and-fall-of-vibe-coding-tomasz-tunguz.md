> The fundamental problem lies in misaligned capabilities and understanding. AI generates working code fast but cannot instill architectural thinking or testing discipline.
> 
> Users gain false competency. They produce working software without grasping underlying complexity or long-term implications.

> Engineering best practices must become as accessible as AI coding tools. Security improvements and test generation should happen in natural language.
> 
> The future involves hybrid workflows. “Vibe coders” prototype solutions while engineers harden successful experiments.
