I appreciate Andy taking the time to write this because I think we need a more balanced view of how to use LLMs in the tech industry.

As with any software we use to get work done, LLMs are a _tool_. And as with any tool, we need to be using them **correctly** and intentionally.

I spent the last month trying to develop my thinking on what _correct_ looks like, but based on the quotes in this article, a lot of people aren't bothering to do that in their firms.
