So, after sorting through my [home filing](/notes/2009-08-07-getting-sorted-2-reference-system-projects) and organizing my projects, I moved on to my filing at cadets. I'll not bother explaining the process as it was much the same as the process I went through [before](/notes/2009-08-07-getting-sorted-2-reference-system-projects).

Essentially, I requisitioned the file cabinet drawer that holds blank forms. As we print most forms on demand, there are only a few blank forms stored in there these days. I gave each of these a file folder and included them in my alpha file system along with everything else.

During this process I also cleaned up my desk, threw out some useless reference folders and created two new ringbinders for reference:

- Annual Camp Folder - For documents relating to camp inspections, drill competitions & formal parades
- Lesson Plans - For paper copies of all the lesson plans used in the squadron

Here are some pictures.
