Leo Babauta of [Zen Habits](http://zenhabits.net) has written a wonderful post on ZTD. Zen To Done is his attempt to simplify David Allen's GTD system - it addresses many of the pitfalls that new GTDers (including myself) often fall into.

[Zen To Done (ZTD): The Ultimate Simple Productivity System](http://zenhabits.net/2007/04/zen-to-done-ztd-the-ultimate-simple-productivity-system/)

Give it a look, it's well worth the read if you're having trouble with GTD.
