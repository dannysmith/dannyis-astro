I finally lost my shit at [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) yesterday.

I've used Warp as my terminal app for about three years and have been getting increasingly pissed off at their ongoing efforts to turn my terminal into a fancy AI-enabled everything-machine.

I understand why – nobody ever got rich by building a terminal app. But when a mistyped `ls -a` causes my terminal to say "You're absoluteley right - let me search online for a better solution" I'm gonna look for a terminal which is **just a fucking terminal**.

And so I found [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/). Which is exactly what I should always have been using as a terminal.

- It's fast as hell.
- It's just a terminal. It doesn't interfere with my shell.
- It plays **so well** with my OS (unlike every other terminal app I've used). There's a [great piece on this here](https://gpanders.com/blog/ghostty-is-native-so-what/).
- The three things above are basically what drove [Mitchell Hashimoto](https://mitchellh.com/) (co-founder of HashiCorp) to work on a **really good** terminal instead of something more lucrative.

## Configuration

Took all of five minutes... 

```
font-family = "Operator Mono"
font-size = 18
window-padding-x = 10
window-padding-y = 10
window-padding-color = background
window-padding-balance = true
theme = "iTerm2 Pastel Dark Background"
adjust-cell-height = 15%
window-save-state = always
background-opacity = 0.95
macos-titlebar-style = tabs
```
## My Favourite Features

The fact I can manage splits like a normal mac user rather than a tmux nerd. These keyboard shortcuts are basically the only "features" I use and it's **bloody lovely**.

<kbd>⌘ + Enter</kbd> - Toggle Fullscreen
<kbd>⌘ + Shift + \ </kbd> - Show All Tabs
<kbd>⌘ + D</kbd> - Split Right
<kbd>⌘ + Shft + D</kbd> - Split Down
<kbd>⌘ + Shft + Enter</kbd> - Zoom Current Split
<kbd>⌘ + [ </kbd> - Next split
<kbd>⌘ + ]</kbd> - Previous Split
<kbd>⌥ + Click</kbd> - Place Cursor

All the other OS-native shortcuts work as expected, it's fast and reliable, and most important of all **I haven't noticed my terminal app at all since I started using Ghostty**. 

Theo Browne has an [interesting video](https://youtu.be/VUxMfyzTM_Y) with a load more context if you wanna dig deeper.
