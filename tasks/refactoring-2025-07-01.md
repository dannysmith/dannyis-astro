### Content SEO Analysis & Recommendations

**Actual Content Scope:** After filtering out Medium redirects (34 articles), only ~6 articles and 4 notes need SEO optimization.

**Key Content for SEO Optimization:**

**Articles (Full Content):**

1. `Organisational Health` (2022) - 2,000+ words, high-value content
2. `Personal CRMs - clay.earth is not what I need` (2024, draft)
3. `Website Redesign Part I` (2020) - Technical content
4. Website Redesign series (Parts II-XVI) - Process documentation

**Notes (Short Content):**

1. `We Need More Calm Companies` (2024, draft)
2. `On Minimalist Packing` (2023)
3. `Apples Thunderbolt 3 Cables` (2023)

**SEO Issues Found:**

- **Missing descriptions**: Only 1 of 6 articles has a meta description
- **Weak title optimization**: Titles don't leverage expertise keywords
- **Inconsistent branding**: Not positioning Danny as remote work consultant

**Specific SEO Recommendations:**

#### High-Priority Optimizations

**1. Organisational Health** (strongest content, already good slug)

- **Current**: "Organisational Health - the silent enabler of success"
- **Improved Title**: "Building Healthy Remote Organizations: The Silent Enabler of Success"
- **Add Description**: "Learn how to build resilient, calm organizations that scale successfully. Proven strategies from remote work consultant Danny Smith for organizational health and team effectiveness." (154 chars)

**2. Personal CRMs** (unique perspective, good for thought leadership)

- **Current**: "Personal CRMs - clay.earth is not what I need"
- **Improved Title**: "Why Personal CRMs Don't Work for Remote Work Consultants"
- **Add Description**: "A consultant's honest take on why personal CRMs fail for relationship-building. Alternative approaches to managing professional networks by remote work expert Danny Smith." (159 chars)

**3. Calm Companies Note** (complement to Organisational Health)

- **Current**: "We Need More Calm Companies"
- **Improved Title**: "Why Remote Companies Must Be Calm Companies"
- **Add Description**: "Discover why calm companies outperform frenzied ones in remote work. Essential insights on sustainable growth and team well-being from organizational health expert Danny Smith." (169 chars - trim to 158)

#### Lower Priority

- **Website Redesign series**: Add consistent descriptions highlighting technical decision-making process
- **Minimalist Packing**: Connect to systems thinking and remote work principles
- **Apple Cables**: Minor technical note, low SEO priority

#### Quick Wins

- Add meta descriptions to all 6 articles (most important)
- Update titles to include expertise positioning
- Ensure draft articles get published (Calm Companies + Personal CRMs are strongest)

**Content Strategy Notes:**

- Focus on the 2-3 strongest pieces rather than optimizing everything
- "Organisational Health" is the cornerstone content - ensure it ranks well
- Personal CRMs piece offers unique perspective in crowded market
- Calm Companies note could be expanded into full article to complement Organisational Health
